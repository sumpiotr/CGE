# CGE

## Overview 

This is a very simple JS gamedev library that makes interfacing with sprites and different events easier to do.

### Warning

CGE uses module JS scripts.
To use CGE you must use a server and not just open the file in a browser.

## Examples

There is an example Arkanoid implementation in the "Examples" folder. It is just an example - it's not fully implemented.
